## üìñ Usage

### Getting Help

The script includes comprehensive PowerShell help documentation:

```powershell
# Get basic help
Get-Help .\cleanup_driver.ps1

# Get detailed help with examples
Get-Help .\cleanup_driver.ps1 -Detailed

# Get full help with all technical details
Get-Help .\cleanup_driver.ps1 -Full

# Get just the examples
Get-Help .\cleanup_driver.ps1 -Examples

# Get help for a specific parameter
Get-Help .\cleanup_driver.ps1 -Parameter DriverInf
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Identify the driver** you want to remove:
```powershell
pnputil /enum-drivers
```

2. **Run the script** as Administrator:
```powershell
# Preview what the script would do (WhatIf mode)
.\cleanup_driver.ps1 -DriverInf "oem124.inf" -WhatIf

# Actually perform the cleanup
.\cleanup_driver.ps1 -DriverInf "oem124.inf"
```

### Parameters

- **`-DriverInf`**: The driver INF file to remove (e.g., "oem124.inf")
- **`-WhatIf`**: Preview mode - shows what would be done without making changes

### WhatIf Mode

The script supports PowerShell's `-WhatIf` parameter for safe preview:

```powershell
# See what the script would do without making any changes
.\cleanup_driver.ps1 -DriverInf "oem124.inf" -WhatIf
```

**WhatIf mode will:**
- Show all commands that would be executed
- Display files that would be removed
- Preview reboot and Safe Mode operations
- Log all preview actions for review
- **Not make any actual system changes**

### What the Script Does

1. **Initial Cleanup**: Attempts standard driver removal
2. **Safe Mode Escalation**: If standard removal fails, boots into Safe Mode
3. **Device Removal**: Removes devices using the driver
4. **Manual Cleanup**: If all else fails, manually removes driver files
5. **Normal Mode Return**: Automatically returns to normal mode when complete

## üìÅ Log Structure

The script creates driver-specific session logs in the `logs` folder:

```
logs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ driver-oem124/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DriverCleanupLog.txt      # Main operation log
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SafeModeDetailedLog.txt   # Safe Mode operations
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CommandOutputLog.txt      # All command outputs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ driver-oem125/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DriverCleanupLog.txt      # Different driver session
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CommandOutputLog.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ driver-oem126/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DriverCleanupLog.txt      # Another driver session
```

Each driver gets its own session folder, allowing you to:
- Track cleanup progress for multiple problematic drivers
- Resume cleanup for a specific driver after reboots
- Keep logs organized by driver name
- Maintain session state across Safe Mode transitions

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Script reports "Not in Safe Mode" when you think you're in Safe Mode:**
- The script uses multiple detection methods
- Check the `SafeModeDetailedLog.txt` for detection details
- Manually verify Safe Mode using `msconfig`

**Driver still present after cleanup:**
- Check the session logs for error details
- Verify you're running as Administrator
- Some drivers may require multiple cleanup attempts

**Script won't reboot to Safe Mode:**
- Use `msconfig` to manually set Safe Mode
- Reboot and run the script again

### Log Analysis

Each session folder contains:
- **DriverCleanupLog.txt**: High-level operations and status
- **SafeModeDetailedLog.txt**: Detailed Safe Mode command outputs
- **CommandOutputLog.txt**: All command executions with timestamps

## üìä Example Output

### Normal Mode
```
Created new driver cleanup session: oem124
Logs will be saved to: .\logs\driver-oem124

[2025-06-30 14:30:25] Starting driver cleanup for oem124.inf - Current State: INITIAL
Session ID: oem124

[2025-06-30 14:30:25] Checking if driver oem124.inf is present in driver store
Command: pnputil /enum-drivers | Select-String -Pattern oem124.inf
Published Name:     oem124.inf

Driver removal failed. Would you like to reboot into Safe Mode now? (Y/N): Y
System will reboot in 10 seconds. Run this script again after reboot.
```

### WhatIf Mode
```
=== WHATIF MODE ENABLED ===
No actual changes will be made to the system
This will show what the script would do
===============================

[2025-06-30 14:30:25] Checking if driver oem124.inf is present in driver store

Command: pnputil /delete-driver oem124.inf /uninstall /force
What if: Would execute command: pnputil /delete-driver oem124.inf /uninstall /force

What if: Would prompt user for Safe Mode reboot
```

### After Safe Mode Reboot

```
Continuing existing driver cleanup session: oem124
Previous session for oem124.inf was in Safe Mode. Continuing device removal process...

[2025-06-30 14:45:12] Starting driver cleanup for oem124.inf - Current State: SAFE_MODE_ACTIVE
Session ID: oem124
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The script follows a state-machine pattern:
- **INITIAL**: First run
- **FAILED_DELETION**: Standard removal failed
- **SAFE_MODE_ACTIVE**: Running in Safe Mode
- **RETRY_ATTEMPTED**: Attempted device removal and retry
- **MANUAL_CLEANUP**: Performing manual file cleanup
- **MANUAL_COMPLETED**: Manual cleanup finished
- **COMPLETED**: Driver successfully removed

This ensures robust recovery and continuation across reboots and interruptions.
